# Challenge 6: Zeno's Paradox - Achilles and the Tortoise

## 🏃‍♂️🐢 Overview

This challenge presents an interactive visualization of one of the most famous paradoxes in mathematics and philosophy: **Zeno's Paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise**. The animation demonstrates how, despite Achilles being faster than the tortoise, he theoretically can never catch up according to Zeno's reasoning.

## 🎯 The Paradox Explained

**Zeno's Argument:**

1. Achilles gives the tortoise a head start
2. By the time Achilles reaches where the tortoise was, the tortoise has moved further ahead
3. When Achilles reaches that new position, the tortoise has moved again
4. This process repeats infinitely, suggesting Achilles can never catch the tortoise

**The Resolution:**
While the paradox creates an infinite number of steps, the sum of this infinite series converges to a finite value, meaning Achilles does eventually catch the tortoise.

## 🚀 Features

## 🧮 Mathematical Concepts Demonstrated

### Infinite Series

The paradox illustrates how an infinite series can have a finite sum:

```
Distance = d₁ + d₂ + d₃ + ... = Σ(d/10ⁿ)
```

### Convergence

Shows how mathematical limits work in practice, as the gap between Achilles and the tortoise approaches zero.

### Speed Ratios

Demonstrates relative motion with Achilles moving 10 times faster than the tortoise.
